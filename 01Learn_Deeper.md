# Learning Deeper    
## The deeper the better?

 - Trade-off:    
The deeper the Neural Network is, the more energy and time need.      

## What do we mean by "deep"?     
 - An SVM has basically two layers, which is not considered as “deeper".

### Classification/regression trees are hierarchical, but not considered as “deep” because every tier (layer) of the trees analyzes the same features. 

## A deep network has a sequence of layers for building a hierarchy of features of increasing complexity
