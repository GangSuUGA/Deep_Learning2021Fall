## MnasNet: 
- Challenge: designing a resourse-constrained mobile model has to carefully balance accuracy and resource-efficiency. 

## Contributions: 
- Introducing a multi-objective neural architecture search approach that optimize both accuracy and real-world latency on mobile devices. 
- Proposing a novel factorized hierarchical search space to enable layer diversity yet still strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size. 
- Demonstrating new state-of-the-art accuracy on both ImageNet classsification and COCO object detection under typical mobile latency constraints.
